# Walking-Dead
C++ console app, 2D dungeon crawler based on Walking Dead theme.  Goal is to make it to the Kingdom and defeat Negan.


Map key: 
‘K’: The Kingdom (goal destination)
‘A’: The Armory
‘H’: The Hilltop
‘#’: Grass, open space, etc.
‘.’: Road
‘S’: A space occupied by Saviors
‘W’: A space occupied by Walkers

There are three ways to increase your chance of winning:

1. Defeat a lot of Negan’s men (Saviors) along the way and take their guns. If you have enough guns you have in your possession 
when you arrive at the Kingdom, you can select other characters to join you for the boss battle.

2. Collect food along the way and when you arrive at the Kingdom, give all your food to King Ezekiel as a gift. 
He will then join the player in the final battle and has significant defense abilities.

3. Go to the armory and trade all your guns for a key. User is not told what this key is for, however when you 
arrive at the Kingdom, you are offered the option to give the key to King Ezekiel. If the player does, they are 
rewarded with a special fighter, “the Tank”, that will take the place of selected character in the final boss battle.
